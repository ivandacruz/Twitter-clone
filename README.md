# Twitter-clone

## ðŸ›‘ Under ðŸ‘· construction ðŸš§, sorry for the inconvenience! ðŸš§

<hr>

> An example clone of twitter to exercise acquired knowledge.ðŸ’¡
### Obs:
    This project was created with the aim of adding knowledge in the technologies involved in it.

### It was built in: ðŸ’»
    React-native and expo

### Create expo app
    npx create-expo-app@latest Twitter-clone --template

When choosing the template, I already chose `typescript` for our routes.

<hr>

### @expo/vector-icons

> This library is installed by default on the template project using npx create-expo-app and is part of the expo package. It is built on top of react-native-vector-icons and uses a similar API. It includes popular icon sets that you can browse at icons.expo.fyi.
